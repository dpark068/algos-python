# DS&A in Python3

## Intro

This repo is contains the basic datastructures and algorithms needed to equip developers to solve leetcode (LC) problems using python. I will be consistently updating this repo with a detailed explanation of the algorithm used to solve problems. The intent is to do enough problems to comfortable solve any Easy-Medium level LC questions.

## Breakdown

This repo contains three major sections Datastructures, Algorithms and leetcode solutions all within its own subdirectory.

### Datastructures & Algorithms

These are developed following https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html

### Leetcode

The solutions shown for each problem are my solutions to tackling LC problems. Generally, there are better ways to optimize space complexity but the focus is to provide an explanation of the algorithm and code its implementation with its own test.
